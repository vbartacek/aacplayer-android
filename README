INSTALLING
==========

Requirements:
    - Android SDK - at least platform 3 (Android 1.5)
    - Android NDK - r4

Preparing FFmpeg sources:
-------------------------

NOTE: Only when build from SVN. You can skip this if downloaded as a zip.
    The zipped version already contains the patched FFmpeg source code.
    Also you do not need to do this if you plan to not compile this particular
    library (see below).

    0) download FFmpeg 0.6.1 sources and extract it to a temporary directory <FFMPEG>
        You can download the sources from the "Downloads" tab:
            http://code.google.com/p/aacplayer-android/downloads/list

    1) copy FFmpeg's directories libavcodec, libavformat and libavutil to jni/ffmpeg:
        cp -R <FFMPEG>/libavcodec jni/ffmpeg
        cp -R <FFMPEG>/libavformat jni/ffmpeg
        cp -R <FFMPEG>/libavutil jni/ffmpeg

    2) Apply patch:
        patch -p0  < ffmpeg-0.6.1.patch


Preparing OpenCORE sources:
-------------------------

NOTE: Only when build from SVN. You can skip this if downloaded as a zip.
    The zipped version already contains the patched OpenCORE source code.
    Also you do not need to do this if you plan to not compile this particular
    library (see below).

    0) checkout OpenCORE aacdec sources and extract it to a temporary directory <OPENCORE>
        You can also download the sources from the "Downloads" tab:
            http://code.google.com/p/aacplayer-android/downloads/list

    1) copy OpenCORE's directories src, include and oscl to jni/opencore-aacdec:
        cp -R <OPENCORE>/src jni/opencore-aacdec
        cp -R <OPENCORE>/include jni/opencore-aacdec
        cp -R <OPENCORE>/oscl jni/opencore-aacdec

    2) Go to directory "jni" and apply patch:
        cd jni
        patch -Np0 < opencore-aacdec.patch


Compiling:
----------

    1) copy sample.local.properties to local.properties and edit local.properties:
        (path to Android SDK)

    2) copy sample.ant.properties to .ant.properties and edit .ant.properties:
        - path to Android NDK
        - list of AAC decoders to be compiled
            - you can choose one of FAAD2, FFmpeg or OpenCORE decoders
                or you can choose two or all of them - follow the instructions
                in the properties file
                NOTE: if you disable a particular decoder, then you do not
                    need its source codes, but also you cannot use at runtime !

    3) run ant

    4) install the APK on the emulator or a device:
        adb install bin/AACPlayer-debug.apk

Note:
    The makefile scripts were tested on linux platform and there is 
    a possibility that it won't work on windows / macosx.


RUNNING
=======

There are these options of playing AAC files:

    1) playing using the FAAD2 decoder native library
            + should work on all 1.5+ platforms
            - slow on emulator
            - patent license is needed

    2) playing using the FFmpeg decoder native library
            + should work on all 1.5+ platforms
            - slow on emulator
            - patent license is needed

    3) playing using the OpenCORE decoder native library
            + fast on all types of devices - even those not having FPU
            + should work on all 1.5+ platforms
            + works on emulator
            - patent license is needed

    /* currenlty not shown in the menu:
    4) playing using an internal AAC decoder (HTC Desire) by splitting the
        stream into small file chunks (having the ".aac" suffix)
            - only some devices support this
            - does not work on emulator
            - the playing is not smooth
    */
